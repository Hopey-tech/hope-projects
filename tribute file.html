  <p>
    Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. Born in Warsaw, Poland in 1867, she later moved to France where she became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize — and remains the only person to ever win Nobel Prizes in **two different scientific fields**: Physics and Chemistry.

  <h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Discovered the elements **polonium** and **radium**.</li>
    <li>Coined the term "radioactivity".</li>
    <li>First woman to win a Nobel Prize (Physics, 1903).</li>
    <li>First person to win a second Nobel Prize (Chemistry, 1911).</li>
    <li>Established mobile radiography units during World War I to help treat wounded soldiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p>
    Marie Curie's legacy goes beyond her scientific achievements. She broke barriers for women in science, defied social norms, and laid the groundwork for future research in cancer treatment and nuclear energy. Her life remains a beacon of dedication, perseverance, and intellectual brilliance.
