  <p>
    Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. Born in Warsaw, Poland in 1867, she later moved to France where she became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize — and remains the only person to ever win Nobel Prizes in **two different scientific fields**: Physics and Chemistry.
